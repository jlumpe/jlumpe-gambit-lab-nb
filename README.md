# jlumpe-midas-lab-nb

Jared Lumpe's digital lab notebook for the MIDAS project. This repo mostly contains exploratory analyses, see [`midas-notebooks-2019`](https://github.com/hesslab-midas/midas-notebooks-2019) and related repos for polished sets of notebooks that are easily meant to be reproducible by others.
