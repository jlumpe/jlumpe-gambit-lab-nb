# 210401 Database v2 Fix Species Overlaps

This experiment aims to fix all species-species overlaps in v1.2 of the database, taking off where the previous experiment (`210303-database-v2-overlaps`) left off.
That experiment applied some minor edits to v1.2 and then located all remaining species-species overlaps.
