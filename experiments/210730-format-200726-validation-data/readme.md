# 210730 Format 200726 validation data

This experiment will put the "gold standard" validation genome files sent to me by David on 200726
(with supplement added 200817) into a format that is easier to work with.

The original data from David is in a Google Drive folder called
[Midas Genomes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S46qrHjOQm-wB7Bha2KQZk4YvOwRvjqc?usp=sharing).


## Experiments

### 210730-arrange-files

This experiment gets a list of all files from both sets sent to me and places them in a common
folder with significantly shortened names.

It also creates and saves a table of old/new file names, plus breaks up the name according to a
common pattern they all have and saves the parts in separate columns (I don't know what they mean
but the information may be useful), and is helpful when differentiating between files with very
similar names.
