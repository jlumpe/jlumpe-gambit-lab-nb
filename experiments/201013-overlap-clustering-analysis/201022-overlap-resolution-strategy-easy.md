# 201019 Overlap resolution strategy (easy cases)


These components should be able to be cleared up without much of a problem.


## Component 3

* Remove 3/16 Jeikeium in cluster 35.


## Component 7

* Remove enterica cluster 8627 (2/4650)


## Component 9

* Lower diameter on nucleatum from diamter of .872 to ~.787 to remove overlap with hwasooki


## Component 14

* Remove multivorans genomes 38 + 41 (misclassified, should be cenocepacia)
* Remove outlier cenocepacia cluster 82 (2/20)


## Component 15

* Remove thailandensis outlier cluster 914 (3/22) - .825 to remainder cluster of diam .38
* Lower threshold on pseudomallei from ~.375 to ~.360 to fix overlap with mallei


## Component 21

* Lower threshold on leguminosarum from ~.884 to ~.870 to avoid overlap with etli


## Component 23

* Remove turicensis cluster 71 (2/4, diameter .005). This is very separated from the other cluster (remaining 2, diameter .511 at distance .971), I favor removing this one because the two genomes are nearly identical.


## Component 24

* Remove splendidus clusters 50 and 37 (4/16), seem to be misclassified crassostreae
* May need to lower threshold on crassostreae very slightly to avoid overlap with remaining splendicus
* Remove outlider tasmaniensis cluster 65 (2/6, distance .860 to remaining cluster of diameter .536)


## Component 25

* Lower albus threshold from .955 to ~.934 to fix overlap with other two.

### Other issues

* Albus has two clusters of diameter .264 and .161 separated by .955.


## Component 28

* Remove Neisseria meningitidis outlier clusters 1530, 2372, 2321 (7/721)
* Remove Neisseria lactamica outlier cluster 1311 (2/6), low diversity (diam .001)
* Remove Gardnerella vaginalis outlier cluster 2348 (3/42)


## Component 29

* Remove salivarius outlier cluster 32 (2/17)


## Component 30

* Remove psittaci outlier cluster 88 (2/48)


## Component 31

* Remove alfalfae outlier genome 1 (1/3) (.338 to other 2 genomes .092 apart)


## Component 32

* Remove harveyi outlier cluster  63 (3/24), possibly misclassified as hyugaensis


## Component 33

* Remove japonicum outlier cluster 22 (2/15). Possibly identical (diam .000).


## Component 34

* Remove japonicum outlier cluster 22 (2/15, both identical)


## Component 37

* Lower pacifica theshold from diameter of .841 to < .830 to avoid overlap with tropica


## Component 39

* Remove licheniformis outlier genome 8 (1/18)


## Component 40

* Lower crocidurae threshold from diameter of .498 to < .474 to avoid overlap with duttonii


## Component 41

* Remove licheniformis outlier cluster 12 (2/7, both identical)
