# 201019 Overlap resolution strategy (easy cases)


These components should be able to be cleared up without much of a problem.


### Component 3

Remove 3/16 Jeikeium in cluster 35.


### Component 7

* Remove enterica cluster 8627 (2/4650)


### Component 9

* Lower diameter on nucleatum from diamter of .872 to ~.787 to remove overlap with hwasooki


### Component 14

* Remove multivorans genomes 38 + 41 (misclassified, should be cenocepacia)
* Remove outlier cenocepacia cluster 82 (2/20)


### Component 15

* Remove thailandensis outlier cluster 914 (3/22) - .825 to remainder cluster of diam .38
* Lower threshold on pseudomallei from ~.375 to ~.360 to fix overlap with mallei


### Component 21

* Lower threshold on leguminosarum from ~.884 to ~.870 to avoid overlap with etli


### Component 23

* Remove turicensis cluster 71 (2/4, diameter .005). This is very separated from the other cluster (remaining 2, diameter .511 at distance .971), I favor removing this one because the two genomes are nearly identical.


### Component 24

* Remove splendidus clusters 50 and 37 (4/16), seem to be misclassified crassostreae
* May need to lower threshold on crassostreae very slightly to avoid overlap with remaining splendicus
* Remove outlider tasmaniensis cluster 65 (2/6, distance .860 to remaining cluster of diameter .536)


### Component 25

* Lower albus threshold from .955 to ~.934 to fix overlap with other two.

#### Other issues

* Albus has two clusters of diameter .264 and .161 separated by .955.


### Component 28

* Remove Neisseria meningitidis outlier clusters 1530, 2372, 2321 (7/721)
* Remove Neisseria lactamica outlier cluster 1311 (2/6), low diversity (diam .001)
* Remove Gardnerella vaginalis outlier cluster 2348 (3/42)


### Component 29

* Remove salivarius outlier cluster 32 (2/17)


### Component 30

* Remove psittaci outlier cluster 88 (2/48)


### Component 31

* Remove alfalfae outlier genome 1 (1/3) (.338 to other 2 genomes .092 apart)


### Component 32

* Remove harveyi outlier cluster  63 (3/24), possibly misclassified as hyugaensis


### Component 33

* Remove japonicum outlier cluster 22 (2/15). Possibly identical (diam .000).


### Component 34

* Remove japonicum outlier cluster 22 (2/15, both identical)


### Component 37

Lower pacifica theshold from diameter of .841 to < .830 to avoid overlap with tropica


### Component 39

* Remove licheniformis outlier genome 8 (1/18)


### Component 40

* Lower crocidurae threshold from diameter of .498 to < .474 to avoid overlap with duttonii


### Component 41

* Remove licheniformis outlier cluster 12 (2/7, both identical)



## Difficult

These don't have a clear resolution from the plots and will require some more work:


### Component 1

* Cerus - spread throughout entire tree, most others well-embedded within it.
* Anthracis, gaemokensis, and weihenstephanensis - in their own very tight clusters and don't need intervention.
* Mycoides - split 5/4 into two strong clusters, very distant.
* Thuringiensis - 4 strong clusters (8/5/3/3) separated, but all withon one super-cluster of 90 Cerus

???


### Component 2


### Component 4

Single super tight cluster of albensis right in the middle of rest of cholerae.


### Component 5

* Aeruginosa - huge tree with not must subclustering.
* Alcaligenes - 2 strong clusters of 2, widely separated from rest but also from each other.
* Denitrificans - 3 strong clusters of 4/3/2 but widely separated in Aeruginosa.


### Component 6

* pneumoniae - 7093/7099 in single strong cluster well separted from others

#### Resolution

* Remove pneumoniae clusters 14151 and 13664 (6/7099)

???


### Component 8

### Component 10

### Component 11

### Component 12

(Omitted from reports due to complexity)

### Component 13

### Component 16

### Component 17

### Component 18

### Component 19

### Component 20

### Component 22

### Component 26

#### Resolution

* Remove frederiksenii outlier cluster 322 (6/22), good cluster but widely separated from rest of species.

#### Other issues

* Could alternatively split species into two subspecies? Other cluster looks solid otherwise.



### Component 27

* Remove pumilus cluster 29 (3/22), appear identical to each other (diam .000) and probably misclassified safensis

???

### Component 35

Fusiformes in two strong clusters (2 + 3) but one cluster is closer to sphaericus than it is to the other.

### Component 36

Cloacae/hormaechei very intermixed, there are some good subclusters but these are also mixed. Cluster 592 may be "true" hormaechei (115 of 123 in cluster) but there are a lot of hormaechei elsewhere.
Xiangfangensis very tightly clustered but deep inside the rest.

### Component 38
