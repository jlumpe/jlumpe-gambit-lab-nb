# 2008921 E coli genome similarity

This is another set of E coli genomes from David to calculate pairwise Jaccard scores for so that they can be compared to alignment identity. This time around he supplied a lot more genomes and will do the alignments afterward, probably selecting pairs based on the Jaccard scores I send back.

## Notebooks

### 200921-ecoli-genome-similarity

Finds kmer signature for each genome using standard settings and calculates pairwise scores.

#### Output

* `data/processed/200921-ecoli-genome-similarity/200921-ecoli-pairwise-similarity-matrix.csv` - Similarity matrix.
* `data/processed/200921-ecoli-genome-similarity/200921-ecoli-pairwise-similarity-tallskinny.csv` - Scores for all unique pairs in tall-skinny format.

#### Results

None to speak of, sent pairwise scores to David.
