# 210717 Recreate MIDAS DB 1.1 Signatures

All overlap resolution notebooks for the past year have used a genomic pairwise distance matrix
calculated in the notebook `210727-find-overlaps/210727-calculate-pw-distances`. This used the
signature file `refseq_curated_1.1beta_200604.midas-signatures.gz`, which I can no longer find on
either my computer or the Google Cloud storage bucket for the project. I believe it was created
in the `build-v1-database/4-calc-signatures` notebook in the `midas-notebooks-2019` repo. I will
need to re-create it.
