# 200818 Gold standard queries set 2

This is the same thing as the `200801-gold-standard-queries` experiment, but using an additional set of 18 genomes shared by David on 200817. As before, I do not know the expected results of these queries.

The same data was used as in the last experiment:
* The "v1.1 beta" version of the v1 database rebuild created 200525
* Signatures (ATGAC/11) for above database calculated 200604
* Original species thresholds from 160901
* Original genus thresholds, all set at 0.2.


## Results

5 of 18 queries did not have a species called, 2 of 18 did not have a genus.


## Output

* `data/processed/200818-gold-standard-queries-set2/200818-refseq-curated-1.1_beta-gold-standard-query-set2-results.csv` - query results, formatted as from `midas_cli`.
