# Validation of v1 database rebuild

## Beta version 2006xx

- Calculated signatures are identical to those from v2 DB in 2017 (200625 expt: of 50752 genomes in new set, 188 not present in v2 set for comparison, 1 differs with Jaccard dist ~0.00038, rest identical).
- 901 groups of genomes with exactly identical signatures are present in this set (200721 expt). None cross species boundaries. Most are small (majority only pairs, <30 with size > 10). Would need to remove 2213 of 50752 genomes in set to leave one representative of each group. There are 22 species with 2-3 genomes that would be left with only one if this were done.
